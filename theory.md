# Theory Question Answers

#### Answer 1


In order to give a meaningful answer to this question, it would be helpful to clarify the context of the scenario. Are we in the present, or is this a hypothetical future? Is the energy source for unlimited computational power sustainable, and how does it affect the environment? If this scenario takes place in the future where most of today's problems have been resolved, it's critical to identify the new challenges and issues that the future society faces. 
I came up with the following idea that could be applied to both present and future issues that society faces.


Optimisation of Resources & Global Sustainability


The software aims to revolutionize decision-making by providing real time simulations of the environmental and sociological impacts of various policies, actions, and events. Its main objective is to guide policymakers, businesses, and individuals towards sustainable choices. With unlimited computing power, we would be able to collect and combine data in real-time from sources such as satellite imagery, environmental sensors, economic indicators and more to better understand ecosystems, economies and societies.

The software could simulate interactions between environmental factors, economic activities and social dynamics that would enable decision-makers to test different scenarios in real-time, allowing for informed choices based on data-driven insights. 

Corporations can use it to model the impact of various business strategies such as supply chain decisions, investment in green technologies, and the development of products with lower environmental footprints.

Researchers can use the software to conduct virtual experiments on a global scale. This could accelerate scientific discoveries related to climate science, ecology, economics, and social dynamics.

The application would include an interactive interface that educates users about the interconnectedness of global systems and raise awareness about global sustainability to foster a sense of responsibility. Transparency in data would promote environmentally conscious behavior among individuals and communities. 

There are numerous challenges to creating such a software as simulating global systems is extremely complex due to the number of variables and their interactions. Developing and fine-tuning accurate models is a difficult task and would require cross-disciplinary cooperation on a global scale. Accessibility to the software, especially for developing regions and marginalized communities, is crucial to preventing further disparities in decision-making and resource allocation. There is also a potential danger in the misuse of the system for political or economic gain. 

Overall, the software has the potential to significantly alter the world by encouraging wise choices that advance sustainability on a global scale. It would bridge the gap between science, policy, and action, enabling humanity to navigate the challenges of climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality more effectively. It can also help in resolving conflicts related to resource allocation and environmental conservation. By providing data-backed solutions, it promotes international cooperation.



#### Answer 2


I start by breaking down the problem to fully understand the requirements of the new feature, I like to draw things out to have a visual reference. 
I do some research into similar features implemented by others, look for documentation and tutorials. 
Then I divide the problem into smaller tasks and make a plan on how to complete them.
At this point I start experimenting with solutions and prototypes while practicing TDD.
When I get stuck I look online or ask a friend for some feedback. Describing the problem to someone helps to understand it better and they can provide feedback and advice on how to proceed.
Once I have a solution I go back and refine or refactor for best performance.
